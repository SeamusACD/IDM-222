			My name is Seamus Donaldson, and I’m a college student at Drexel University studying interactive digital media. In the time that I’ve been here, I’ve had the pleasure of meeting people from all over the world, and have enjoyed sharing the new cultures they’ve brought with them. I’ve gotten a taste of what independence is really like and, I’ve also gotten really bad food poisoning from the dining hall… twice.

		While I have become quite fond of Philadelphia, my roots are in Cambridge. I grew up in north, about five minutes by foot from Alewife, and fifteen from Harvard. I went to the Peabody elementary school on rindge ave as a kid, and after that went on to attend the Cambridge Rindge and Latin High School, which is where my story really begins.
