            Before I got out of highschool my graphic design teacher forced each senior to compile all the best work we'd done, and put it on a single CD so we would always be able to view our work. Of course one does not simply burn a disk, call it portfolio, and move on with the day; instead we did the full package design on our own personal CD portfolio.

            This project was mainly about promoting the East Cambridge Savings Bank Savings 101 seminar. They wanted a web page that would allow people access to the Savings 101 account, a poster detailing the information on the seminar they were holding, and a pamphlet that laid out information is a simple way.

              This piece was an assignment for one of my classes. We were to take one of the ten amendments and depict it as best we could. I chose the 8th amendment which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment for several reasons. The first reason is because often times this refers to torture that happens to POWs, and even more specifically terror suspects in the middle east. The second reason I chose the 8th amendment was for it's visual impact.

              This piece is a great example of my many interests coming together at once. The assignment was to make a newsletter using Adobe InDesign. I chose to focus on Isis, and it's influence as it is something that fascinates me.
